## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Upgrade to **Dokan 2.3.0** through `dokan-sys`.
- Bump dependencies.
- **Library breaking change:** DOKAN_FILE_INFO.DeleteOnClose was renamed DOKAN_FILE_INFO.DeletePending. Same
  expectation (remove the object) but is set when last handle on the object is being closed dokan-dev/dokany#883.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-10-04

### Added

- `FileSystemHandle` to send a `DOKAN_HANDLE` across threads.
- `map_win32_error_to_ntstatus`
- `win32_ensure`
- In `memfs` example: add status messages and show how another thread can unmount the file system.

### Changed

- Upgrade to **Dokan 2.0.6** through `dokan-sys`.
- Split the code into multiple files.
- Replace `Drive` builder by `FileSystemMounter` and `MountOptions`.
- Operations errors are simply `NTSTATUS`.  
  To return errors from `GetLastError`, use `win32_ensure` or `map_win32_error_to_ntstatus`.
- Access mount point list through an iterator.

### Fixed

- Access to dangling pointer caused panic when the file system handle was used.  
  It's the reason for `FileSystemMounter`, which keeps needed variables onto the stack.
